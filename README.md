## Introduction

This project simulates a seat reservation system for a train coach with 80 seats. Each row contains 7 seats, except the last row which has only 3 seats. Users can reserve up to 7 seats at a time, with a priority on booking seats within the same row. If that's not possible, the system will book nearby seats.
